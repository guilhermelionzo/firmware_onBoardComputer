### This repository is intended for the versioning of the code used in my graduation thesis.

## Abstract
>Researchers from the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) are studying the feasibility of a CubeSat 3U mission, as a technology demonstrator. Some studies are already being carried out, in order to offer solutions for this future mission. The present research is aimed at the construction of an Onboard Computer (OBC) for this future mission. During the development of the OBC, it was used the co-design methodology, which allowed for the development of hardware and software at the same time. During the design of the theoretical project, it was chosen the microcontroller and another devices to compose the OBC's \textit {hardware}. For the embedded software, the FreeRTOS operating system was defined as the operating system. During the protoboard test, it was possible to verify: the consumption of the microcontroller; modes of operation of the embedded software; the acquisition and data storage; etc. Some requirements established at the beginning were not fulfilled due to the complexity of the project. Points that were not developed during the search were raised and are present in the last section.

There is many bugs:bug: in the code, so be free to suggest improvements and features :smile:
